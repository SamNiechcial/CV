## Sam Niechcial

I am a full stack web developer, I've just finished the Makers Academy bootcamp, and I'm looking for work in web development.

Independently, in pairs, and in small teams, I've created object-oriented applications, in both Ruby and JavaScript, using a variety of frameworks including Ruby on Rails and Express. At Makers, we are trained to be language agnostic developers, with a strong foundation in the principles of OO design, so I will be quick to pick up syntax and follow style guides in new languages at any job I take up. I'm fully up to date with modern web development best practice. All the projects I've written or contributed to writing have been created using a strict test first approach, and I follow good practice in git workflow, agile methodology (with regular stand-ups and two day sprints) and continuous feedback.

I'm a socially and environmentally conscientious ENTP guy with ADH tendencies and a passion for music, reading, forging new neural pathways and writing clean and efficient code. As a outgoing debater personality type, I'm not afraid to raise issues I may have with working practices wherever I see them, and will make an engaging and enlivening addition to any team which takes me on.

In my diverse career to date, I've worked in healthcare, social care, tech support and startups, fuelled throughout by my desire to learn, try my hand at new challenges, and help those less fortunate than myself.

I'm currently looking for a Junior Developer role, ideally in a unbounded environment where taking best practice approaches (and having the freedom to debate those approaches) are more important than blindly following orders, and ethical codes are valued over dress codes.

## Interests

- Aviation. Before travelling I trained to fly light aircraft to the point where I had several solo hours in my logbook. Aviation is not a cheap hobby, but it is definitely something I intend to return to once I'm earning enough to afford it.

- Mechanics. I completed a project to restore a Honda CB400F motorcycle over three years of Sundays with my father. My next project will be a resto-mod on an old Porsche, probably a 924 or a 944, with a developer friend.

- Music. Having played since the age of 9, I'm an accomplished drummer, and I have also been a DJ since the age of 15. As a result, I have a very diverse taste in music, and enjoy listening to some pieces from almost any genre, from Jazz to House and Hip Hop to Drum & Bass. An opportunity to work in any company working in music would be a big draw for me.

- Photography. My father introduced me to photography at a young age with an ancient Russian film camera that he inherited from his father, and since then I've been an avid fan of the art of capturing light. I currently own a Nikon DSLR, but mostly prefer to work from my IPhone X, as I always have it with me, and the editing capabilities of the VSCO app allow me to create professional-looking imagery on the fly.

- Reading, mostly Science Fiction and non-fiction titles. Favourite authors include Iain M. Banks, Peter Hamilton and Alastair Reynolds, favourite non-fiction titles include "Bad Science" by Ben Goldacre and "Homo Deus" by Yuval Noah Harari.

- Staying active. I swim up to 6 Km a week, and also enjoy rock climbing and yoga. As far as competitive sports are concerned, I also enjoy basketball and table tennis. I have found over the course of my learning at Makers Academy that keeping up an exercise regimen is essential to my staying at peak performance where writing code is concerned.
