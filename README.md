## Sam Niechcial

I am a full stack web developer, I've just finished the Makers Academy bootcamp, and I'm looking for work in web development.

I'm a socially and environmentally conscientious ENTP guy with a passion for music, reading, forging new neural pathways and writing clean and efficient code. As a outgoing debater personality type, I'm not afraid to raise issues I may have with working practices wherever I see them, and will make an engaging and enlivening addition to any team which takes me on.

In my diverse career to date, I've worked in healthcare, social care, tech support and startups, fuelled throughout by my desire to learn, try my hand at new challenges, and help those less fortunate than myself.

I've been a computer user for as long as I can remember. In fact, the first code that I ever wrote was in BASIC on a green-screen BBC computer at primary school. Independently, in pairs, and in small teams, I've created object-oriented applications, in both Ruby and JavaScript, using a variety of frameworks including Ruby on Rails, Node and Express.

My ideal development role would be in a small to medium sized company, with a good sense of community, where taking best practice approaches (and having the freedom to debate those approaches) are more important than blindly following orders, and ethical codes are valued over dress codes.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (March to June 2018)

- Graduated 8th of June 2018

I'm curious and passionate about computing in general and code in particular. I enjoy the challenge of writing Kata solutions on code wars, and as well as attending Makers, I've taken it upon myself to attend meet-ups (to engage with the welcoming coding community) and hackathons (to learn and contribute to open source projects). The next one I will be attending is the NHS hackathon at the end of June, which promises to be a great combination of worthwhile work, with interesting code, from a background in which I have some experience. I want to present our final project prescription blockchain there, as I feel it really has the capacity to make a difference.

At Makers, we are trained to be independent, language agnostic developers with a strong foundation in the principles of Object-Oriented design. This approach has given me a strong Google game. I understand the importance of referring frequently to the documentation, I'm aware of other resources (like stack overflow), and I know how to escalate my process accordingly when I'm blocked. As a result, I'm competent building test-driven full stack applications in Ruby (standalone or with Rails, tested with RSpec) or Javascript (with Node & Express, tested with Jasmine). I will be quick to pick up syntax in new languages at any job I take up, and I won't prove an unnecessary drain on resources while doing so.

I'm fully up to date with modern web development best practice. All the projects I've written or contributed to writing have been created using a strict test first approach. I follow good practice in git workflow, as my bank tech test above demonstrates. I have a tendency toward perfectionism, which I consciously mediate due to the constant time pressure in the development environment, but one thing that it definitely drives me towards is writing clean, DRY, readable code.

I'm a great collaborator, and I love to work in pairs or in teams. I spent an entire week fairly early on in the course at Makers teaching the same first half of the week's challenges to four separate daily pair partners, because I am of the opinion that the best way to tell if you really know something is if you can teach it well!

When I was working in teams, I really enjoyed the whole process of collaborating with and organising the team, and enforced good management of the full agile workflow, with two day sprint plans, daily stand-ups and retros and regular mini-retro/knowledge shares for continuous feedback. I took it upon myself to keep a well maintained Kanban board, with metrics to improve our time on task estimations, and encouraged my team members to consistently break down big goals into smaller, more manageable tasks.

## Interests

- Aviation. Before travelling I trained to fly light aircraft to the point where I had several solo hours in my logbook. Aviation is not a cheap hobby, but it is definitely something I intend to return to once I'm earning enough to afford it.

- Mechanics. I completed a project to restore a Honda CB400F motorcycle over three years of Sundays with my father. My next project will be a resto-mod on an old Porsche, probably a 924 or a 944, with a developer friend.

- Music. Having played since the age of 9, I'm an accomplished drummer, and I have also been a DJ since the age of 15. As a result, I have a very diverse taste in music, and enjoy listening to some pieces from almost any genre, from Jazz to House and Hip Hop to Drum & Bass. An opportunity to work in any company working in music would be a big draw for me.

- Photography. My father introduced me to photography at a young age with an ancient Russian film camera that he inherited from his father, and since then I've been an avid fan of the art of capturing light. I currently own a Nikon DSLR, but mostly prefer to work from my IPhone X, as I always have it with me, and the editing capabilities of the VSCO app allow me to create professional-looking imagery on the fly.

- Reading, mostly Science Fiction and non-fiction titles. Favourite authors include Iain M. Banks, Peter Hamilton and Alastair Reynolds, favourite non-fiction titles include "Bad Science" by Ben Goldacre and "Homo Deus" by Yuval Noah Harari.

- Staying active. I swim up to 6 Km a week, and also enjoy rock climbing and yoga. As far as competitive sports are concerned, I also enjoy basketball and table tennis. I have found over the course of my learning at Makers Academy that keeping up an exercise regimen is essential to my staying at peak performance where writing code is concerned.
